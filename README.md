# Sumo-Robot
## About
This project involves the development of a control system for a sumo robot using an Arduino microcontroller. The robot can move forward, backward, and turn left or right based on motor control commands. The system uses the Adafruit Motor Shield library for motor control and includes functions for gradually increasing and decreasing motor speeds.

## Features
- **Motor Control:**
  - Control the robot's movement with functions to move forward, backward, and turn.
  - Gradual acceleration and deceleration of motors for smooth movement.

- **Pin Configuration:**
  - Define motor control pins for easy setup and modification.

- **Adafruit Motor Shield Integration:**
  - Utilize the Adafruit Motor Shield library for enhanced motor control.

## Requirements
- Arduino board
- Adafruit Motor Shield
- DC motors
- Power supply
- Arduino IDE

## Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sumo-robot-control-system.git
   ```
2. **Open the Project:**
   - Open the project in the Arduino IDE.

3. **Connect the Hardware:**
   - Connect the DC motors to the Adafruit Motor Shield.
   - Attach the Motor Shield to the Arduino board.
   - Connect the power supply to the motors and the Arduino board.

4. **Upload the Code:**
   - Connect your Arduino to your computer and upload the code.

5. **Run the System:**
   - After uploading, the robot will execute the movement commands in the loop function, moving forward, turning, and moving backward sequentially.

## Usage
- **Setup:**
  - Initialize motor control pins and set the initial motor speeds.
  - Configure serial communication for optional debugging.

- **Motor Functions:**
  - `moveForward()`: Moves the robot forward with gradual acceleration.
  - `moveBackward()`: Moves the robot backward with gradual deceleration.
  - `turn(direction)`: Turns the robot left or right based on the specified direction.

- **Control Flow:**
  - The `loop` function sequences the robot's movements, demonstrating forward movement, turning, and backward movement.
